Some programming languages have a concept called type casting which means more or less: if I want to convert a number or another entity to another type, I have to make the conversion explicit.

Consider the following example converting a number to a string:
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello";
const year = 2019;
const yearString = year.toString();
greeting + yearString; // returns "Hello2019"
```

Which of the following is an example of implicit coercion in JavaScript?

<!-- explanation -->

In JavaScript there is a subtle mechanic called implicit conversion that does not prevent us from adding numbers and strings. The addition operator + in JavaScript automatically converts any of the two operands to a string if at least one of them isâ€¦ a string!
